# Changes Since 20101108.1957

* Compile kroc and the various libraries distributed using -mmacosx-version-min=10.4
* Compile native parts of OccPlug and the Updater using -mmacosx-version-min=10.5

This probably means that we still only support 10.5 and up. Let us know if you require support
for 10.4.

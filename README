KRoC -- Source Distribution
===========================


Prerequisites
-------------

To compile and use KRoC, you will need to have the following already
installed on your machine:

 - the bash shell

 - the GNU toolchain -- i.e. GCC 2.95.2 or later, binutils 2.0 or later,
   GNU awk, GNU make

 - pkg-config

 - the C development headers

 - Python 2.4 or later

 - xsltproc

Some occam-pi modules can optionally make use of other native libraries
if available:

 - libpng

 - SDL and SDL_Sound

 - OpenGL

 - MySQL

 - Player

To check out and update KRoC from the Subversion repository, you will
also need:

 - Subversion

 - automake 1.8 or later, autoconf 2.52 or later (but not autoconf 2.64,
   which is buggy)

On Debian-based systems, we suggest installing the following packages:

  bash gcc binutils gawk make automake autoconf pkg-config
  libc6-dev libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-sound1.2-dev libgl1-mesa-dev
  libmysqlclient15-dev libpng12-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev
  libplayercore2-dev libplayerc2-dev libltdl3-dev
  perl python xsltproc subversion

On x86-64 Debian systems, you will also need the packages that allow
32-bit binaries to be compiled:

  libc6-dev-i386 lib32gcc1 gcc-multilib


Installation
------------

For installation instructions, please see:

  http://projects.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/kroc/trac/wiki/Installation


Configuration
-------------

Before using KRoC, remember to source the relevant setup file:

  - ". PREFIX/bin/kroc-setup.sh" for Bourne-style shells such as bash

  - "source PREFIX/bin/kroc-setup.csh" for C-style shells such as csh/tcsh

It may be convenient to include this command in your shell's startup
file (e.g. "~/.bash_profile", "~/.cshrc", or "/etc/profile").


Directories
-----------

  demos/

    Some standalone demo programs written in occam-pi.

  doc/

    Various items of documentation. The "essentially-kroc.txt" file is a
    good place to start.

  install/

    This is the default installation directory for KRoC.

  modules/

    Reusable modules that can be used in occam-pi programs. Each module
    contains a "libsrc" directory with the module's source code, and an
    "examples" directory with demonstration and test programs.

    The "modules/course" directory will probably be of particular
    interest, since it contains the examples and exercises used to teach
    occam-pi at the University of Kent.

  runtime/

    Low-level runtime support code for the occam-pi environment.

  tests/

    Functional test programs for occam-pi systems.

  tools/

    Tools for compiling, debugging, packaging and documenting occam-pi
    programs.

  licenses/

    Copies of relevant software licenses (see Licensing below).

Note: most directories contain further README files.

Reporting problems
------------------

Known bugs are given in the top-level BUGS file. If KRoC fails to
compile or work correctly on your system, please mail our bug tracking
system at <kroc-bugs@kent.ac.uk>, including a brief description of the
problem and a copy of the "typescript" file generated by "build".

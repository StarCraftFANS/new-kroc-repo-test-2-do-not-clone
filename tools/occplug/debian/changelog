jedit-plugin-occplug (0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed the install location to /usr/share/java (as is the case with the
    other plugins installed by jEdit). Then symlink to /usr/share/jedit/jars
    (which incidentally, the other jEdit plugins do not do. This means that
    jEdit does not seem them though).

Basic channel communications:
-----
These currently work. 
  c ! SIGNAL
  c ? SIGNAL

Extended Rendevous
-----
  c ?? SIGNAL


 c[i] ? SIGNAL
 c[i] ! SIGNAL
 PROTOCOL P IS SIGNAL:
 p ! SIGNAL
 (etc. as above)
 PROTOCOL PP IS SIGNAL; SIGNAL:
 pp ! SIGNAL; SIGNAL
 pp ? SIGNAL; SIGNAL
 PROTOCOL Q
   CASE
     tag; SIGNAL
 :
 q ! tag; SIGNAL
 q ? CASE tag; SIGNAL
 q ? CASE
   tag; SIGNAL

and ALT versions of all the above.

And then, since it's a data type, there are various other things you
should either be able to do with it or get sensible error messages for:

 SIGNAL v:
 INT i:
 v := SIGNAL
 v := SIGNAL i    -- careful with this one -- SIGNAL as a type name in
                  -- a value context; bet it misparses as the above or
                  -- vica versa
 i := INT SIGNAL
 w IS v:
 SIGNAL w IS v:
 VAL SIGNAL vw IS v:
 PROC p (VAL SIGNAL a) ...
 CASE v ...
